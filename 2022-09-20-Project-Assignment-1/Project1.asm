			PROTOTYPE, comment out if you are using Irvine32
			ExitProcess PROTO = fn/procedure prototype to transfer/return execution to windows services
			otherwise, windows canï¿½t run any execution & windows crashes
			dwExitCode is parameter

total WORD ? ; ? char denotes that total is yet to be defined.

						add array element 2, 
						the +2 denotes going further 2 bytes
						meaning another word.
						This then navigates to the next element of the
